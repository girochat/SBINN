### SBINN: Systems Biology-Informed Neural Networks
##### Overview
This repository contains the code to implement a Systems Biology Informed Neural Network (SBINN), a novel approach inspired from Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which integrates scientific knowledge into neural network architectures in the form of ODEs/PDEs. SBINNs represent a powerful tool for incorporating mechanistic knowledge from systems biology with the flexibility and learning capabilities of neural networks. It can be used for forward (dynamics prediction) and reverse modeling (parameter inference), and for equation discovery using additional tools and methods such as SINDy for symbolic regression.
